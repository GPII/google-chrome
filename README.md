# UI Options Plus (UIO+) for Morphic

![CI build status badge](https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

UIO+ for Morphic builds on UIO+ by providing a connection to [Morphic](https://morphic.world). On a Morphic enabled
machine, user preferences can be supplied from a keyed in preference set. [UIO+](
https://github.com/fluid-project/uio-plus#ui-options-plus-uio) allows you to customize websites to match your own
personal needs and preferences.

_**Note**: The ability to apply an adaptation will vary from page to page_
_**Note**: UIO+ for Morphic is not compatible with Morphic Classic v1.3.5 or earlier_

UI Options Plus for Morphic is the result of a joint effort of the Inclusive Design Research Centre at OCAD University
and the Trace R&D Center at University of Maryland under funding for the FLOE Project from the William and Flora Hewlett
Foundation and the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR),
Administration for Community Living under grant #90RE5027.

## Building the extension

### Dependencies

Install *grunt-cli* globally:

```bash
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

This will generate a `dist` directory at the root of the project. The `dist` directory contains the built version of
UIO+ for Morphic. This can be run as an unpacked extensions or zipped to be published on the Chrome Web Store.

```bash
grunt build

#or

npm run build
```

The `--version_name` flag can be set to specify a version name to include in the manifest file. This is useful when
publishing a beta release.

```bash
grunt build --version_name="0.1.0 beta 14"
```

## Testing

Run all the tests and generate reports which can be viewed in the browser from the "reports" directory:

```bash
npm test
```

## Publishing to the Chrome Web Store

1. Prepare Code.
   1. Ensure that all of the code, that should be published, has been merged into the master branch.
   2. Ensure that the code in master is working as expected.
      1. Run tests: `npm test`
      2. Lint: `grunt lint` or `npm run lint`
      3. Manual test build.
         1. Create a build: `grunt build` or `npm run build`
         2. Load unpacked extension into Chrome.
            1. In Chrome go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
            2. Ensure that "Developer mode" is enabled.
            3. Click "Load unpacked".
            4. From the File Dialog, navigate to the "gpii-chrome-extension" repo and select the `dist` directory.
         3. Test all of the preferences and ensure that they apply to web page content correctly.
            1. Refresh any Browser Tabs/Windows that were open prior to installing the extension.
            2. The preferences should be tested individually and in combinations to ensure that interactions between the
               preferences are working properly. For example (Text-to-Speech and Syllabification, Text-to-Speech and
               Reading Mode).
            3. Multiple web pages should be tested. However, not all preferences will work with all sites.
         4. Load Morphic and ensure that logging in users (e.g. [uioPlusCommon](
            https://github.com/GPII/universal/blob/master/testData/preferences/uioPlusCommon.json5)) applies the
            preferences to UIO+.
   3. Increase the "version" number in the [manifest](
      https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension/blob/master/extension/manifest.json#L5) file, and push changes to
      master.
2. Create the release package.
   1. Create a release build: `grunt build`
      1. If making a beta, use the `--version_name` flag with the beta release number to set the
      [version name](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/version#version_name) in the manifest file. (e.g.
      `grunt build --version_name="0.1.0 beta 14"`). The version name will be displayed instead of the version number in
      the Chrome Web Store.
   2. Create of a zip archive of the contents of the `dist` directory. This will be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store.
3. Publish to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
   1. Go to the Developer Dashboard on the Chrome Web Store and login.
   2. On the Developer Dashboard, click “Edit”; located on the right hand side of the UI Options Plus (UIO+) for morphic
      listing.
   3. On the UI Options Plus (UIO+) edit page, click “upload updated package” and upload the zip created in step 2.2
      above.
   4. Update the “Detailed description” field as necessary. Similar information is contained in this README.
   5. Update the screenshots if necessary. They will need to be the exact size requested.
   6. Set the “Visibility Options” to “Unlisted”. This means that UIO+ for Morphic will be available for install from
      the Chrome Web Store, but won't be searchable. It will only be accessible by the direct link.
   7. Click "Preview Changes".
      1. Verify that everything appears correct. Pay particular attention to anything that was changed,
         e.g., version number/name, descriptions, screenshots, etc.
   8. When everything appears correct, publish the changes.
      1. The actual publishing to the Chrome Web Store will take some time, and may need to go through a review process.
   9. Tag the master branch with the release (e.g. v0.1.0-beta.10).
   10. Create a GitHub release for the tag.
       1. Go to the [gpii-chrome-extension](https://github.com/GPII/gpii-chrome-extension) GitHub page.
       2. Click on "releases".
       3. Click "Draft a new release".
       4. For "Tag Version" and "Release Title", enter the tag name created in step 3.9 (e.g., v0.1.0-beta.10).
       5. For the description, add a summary of changes and any other relevant information. View prior releases, for
         example.
       6. Attach the build zip file created in step 2.2. Before uploading, make sure the file is named "build_{tag}.zip"
          (e.g., build_v0.1.0-beta.10.zip).
       7. If this is a beta release, check "This is a pre-release".
       8. After all the information has been entered correctly, click "Publish release".
4. Verify Published UIO+ for Morphic.
   1. Ensure that the contents of the UIO+ for Morphic page on the Chrome Web Store appear correct. Double check things
      like version number/name, descriptions, screenshots and etc.
   2. Install the version from the Chrome Web Store, and run through the manual testing again. (See: step 1.2.3 above)
   3. If everything is working, announce release where required (e.g., fluid-work list, GPII list, project teams, etc.).
      If there are any issues, fix them and repeat the process.
